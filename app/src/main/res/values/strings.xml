        Performance Achieved:\n\n
        The application successfully analyzes the text from the provided URL or selected file.
        The analysis process takes an average of 15 seconds for a typical file size.
        This performance is suitable for most use cases but can be improved.\n\n
        Possible Improvements:\n\n
        1. Optimize the text processing algorithms to reduce computation time.\n
        2. Utilize multi-threading to parallelize the analysis process.\n
        3. Implement caching mechanisms to avoid reprocessing the same files.\n
        4. Optimize network requests to reduce latency when fetching text from URLs.\n
        5. Profile the application to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
